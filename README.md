# EMH: Earthen Master's Hammer

A 'World of Warcraft: The War Within' addon to simplify the use of the blacksmithing item "Earthen Master's Hammer".

## Installation

Download the addon from Curseforge. It will automatically install, and after a reload (`/reload`), it will be usable.

You can also download and install it manually from Curseforge or GitHub. Once you have downloaded the package, navigate to your game folder, then `_retail_` -> `Interface` -> `AddOns` and place it there. Then extract the package, and after a reload, it will be usable.

## Usage

The frame will automatically open when talking to a repair merchant. You can also open it manually by typing the following command in the chat:

```
/emh
```

Please keep in mind that this is my first WoW addon and that English is not my first language.
