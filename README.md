# EMH: Earthen Master's Hammer

A 'World of Warcraft: The War Within' AddOn to simplify the use of the blacksmithing item "Earthen Master's Hammer".

## Installation

Download the addon from Curseforge. It will automatically install, and after a reload (`/reload`), it will be usable.

You can also download and install it manually from Curseforge or GitHub. Once you have downloaded the package, navigate to your game folder, then `_retail_` -> `Interface` -> `AddOns` and place it there. Then extract the package, and after a reload, it will be usable.

## Usage

The frame will automatically open when talking to a repair merchant (if repairs are needed). You can also open it manually by typing the following command in the chat:

```
/emh
```

In the Settings frame, you can check the items that you can repair (I did not find a way to automate that), and then, in the Main frame, you can repair any equipped item by clicking the same button.
If you do it while talking to a repair merchant, it will also record the savings you made while using the AddOn.

Please keep in mind that this is my first WoW addon and that English is not my first language.
