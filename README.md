# EMH: Earthen Master's Hammer

A 'World of Warcraft: The War Within' AddOn to simplify the use of the blacksmithing item "Earthen Master's Hammer".

## Installation

Download the addon from Curseforge. It will automatically install, and after a reload (`/reload`), it will be usable.

You can also download and install it manually from Curseforge or GitHub. Once you have downloaded the package, navigate to your game folder, then `_retail_` -> `Interface` -> `AddOns` and place it there. Then extract the package, and after a reload, it will be usable.

**Note:** The directory in `AddOns` should be named `EarthenMasterHammerAddon` and should directly contain the files. Depending on where you download it from, this may not be the case immediately.

## Usage

When talking to a merchant who can repair (and if you have damaged equipment), the **Main Frame** will automatically open.  
Otherwise, you can type `/emh` in the chat or use the button in the AddOn compartment in the top-right corner, just below the calendar.

In the **Settings Frame**, select the items you can repair based on your Blacksmithing nodes.  
Then, in the **Main Frame**, use the button to repair all damaged equipment. The AddOn will also track how much gold you've saved using the hammerâ€”so you can brag to your non-blacksmith friends!
