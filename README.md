# EMH: Earthen Master's Hammer

A 'World of Warcraft: The War Within' AddOn to simplify the use of the blacksmithing item "Earthen Master's Hammer".

## Installation

### (Automatic) CurseForge Application

Using the CurseForge application, you can install this AddOn automatically:

1. Search '**EarthenMasterHammer**' on the application.
2. Click the 'Download' button
3. Reload your game (`/reload`) to activate the AddOn.

### (Manual) Download from CurseForge Website

On the CurseForge website, you can download the AddOn package from its [official page](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/emh). Click the 'Download' button and select the latest version.

### (Manual) Download from GitHub

On the ['Releases' page](https://github.com/Iryonis/EarthenMasterHammerAddon/releases) of the GitHub repository of the AddOn, you can download the package by clicking on '**EarthenMasterHammerAddon-x.x.x.zip**' from the latest release.

### (Manual) Installing the Package

Once you have downloaded the package:

1. Move it to your `AddOns` folder, which should be located in your game directory, under:
   `_retail_` → `Interface` → `AddOns`
2. Extract the package.
3. Reload your game (`/reload`) to activate the AddOn.

**Note:** The folder inside `AddOns` must be named `EarthenMasterHammerAddon` and should directly contain the files. Depending on where you downloaded it from, you may need to adjust this manually.

## Usage

When talking to a merchant who can repair (and if you have damaged equipment), the **Main Frame** will automatically open.  
Otherwise, you can type `/emh` in the chat or use the button in the AddOn compartment in the top-right corner, just below the calendar.

In the **Settings Frame**, select the items you can repair based on your Blacksmithing nodes.  
Then, in the **Main Frame**, use the button to repair all damaged equipment. The AddOn will also track how much gold you've saved using the hammer—so you can brag to your non-blacksmith friends!

By right-clicking on the AddOn frame, you can reset its position.
